%% Overview
% This example stitches together a collection of point clouds that was
% captured with Kinect to construct a larger 3-D view of the scene. The
% example applies ICP to two successive point clouds. This type of
% reconstruction can be used to develop 3-D models of objects or build 3-D
% world maps for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).

%% If we haven't released the devices, then release them
exist colorDevice;
if ans
    release(colorDevice);
    release(depthDevice);
end


%% Lets connect to the devices
colorDevice = imaq.VideoDevice('kinect',1)
depthDevice = imaq.VideoDevice('kinect',2)




%% Register Two Point Clouds


% Extract two consecutive point clouds and use the first point cloud as
% reference.
ptCloudRef = getPointCloud(colorDevice, depthDevice);
ptCloudCurrent = getPointCloud(colorDevice, depthDevice);

%%
% The quality of registration depends on data noise and initial settings of
% the ICP algorithm. You can apply preprocessing steps to filter the noise
% or set initial property values appropriate for your data. Here,
% preprocess the data by downsampling with a box grid filter and set the
% size of grid filter to be 10cm. The grid filter divides the point cloud
% space into cubes. Points within each cube are combined into a single
% output point by averaging their X,Y,Z coordinates.

%%
gridSize = 0.1;
fixed = pcdownsample(ptCloudRef, 'gridAverage', gridSize);
moving = pcdownsample(ptCloudCurrent, 'gridAverage', gridSize);

% Note that the downsampling step does not only speed up the registration,
% but can also improve the accuracy.

%% 
% To align the two point clouds, we use the ICP algorithm to estimate the
% 3-D rigid transformation on the downsampled data. We use the first point
% cloud as the reference and then apply the estimated transformation to the
% original second point cloud. We need to merge the scene point cloud with
% the aligned point cloud to process the overlapped points.

%%
% Begin by finding the rigid transformation for aligning the second point
% cloud with the first point cloud. Use it to transform the second point
% cloud to the reference coordinate system defined by the first point
% cloud.

%%
tform = pcregistericp(moving, fixed, 'Metric','pointToPlane','Extrapolate', true);
ptCloudAligned = pctransform(ptCloudCurrent,tform);

%%
% We can now create the world scene with the registered data. The
% overlapped region is filtered using a 1.5cm box grid filter. Increase the
% merge size to reduce the storage requirement of the resulting scene point
% cloud, and decrease the merge size to increase the scene resolution.

%%
mergeSize = 0.01;
ptCloudScene = pcmerge(ptCloudRef, ptCloudAligned, mergeSize);

%% Stitch a Sequence of Point Clouds
% To compose a larger 3-D scene, repeat the same procedure as above to
% process a sequence of point clouds. Use the first point cloud to
% establish the reference coordinate system. Transform each point cloud to
% the reference coordinate system. This transformation is a multiplication
% of pairwise transformations.

% Store the transformation object that accumulates the transformation.
